These scripts will take GRACE spherical harmonic coefficients 
and process them in a manner similar to other mascon approaches.  
The difference is that a user can change the parameters and mascon 
shapes, etc, easily without having the full gravity field 
determination package. 

To run the grace.tiles.py script, one needs to specify some of 
the directory names that point to the data in the main script, 
called grace.tiles.py.  These directories are called 'data_dir', 
etc, and can be found in the script after:

#-----------------------------------------------------
#  set control parameters
#-----------------------------------------------------

The directory structure is arbitrary, and can be reconfigured
by the user.

There are a few places where one can plot the intermediate 
results to check whether the script is operating as expected.  
Look for: "# plot for debugging purposes"

Spherical harmonic coefficients can be found here:

The script has been separated into a number of steps, and to 
speed up the process, certain steps can be switched on and off 
using flags.  For example, once the tiles have been defined, and 
a tile transfer matrix created, the matrix does not have to be 
re-created; instead it can be read from a file.  

Gridded GRACE data can be used to compute an a priori variance 
estimate.  These data are available here:
